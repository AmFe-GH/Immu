## Overview
In the neural network model section of this study, we developed a highly interpretable training strategy known as robust dynamic feature selection. This approach, combined with gated neural networks, significantly mitigates the black-box nature of deep learning models in biomedical applications.
### Highlights:
- **Novel Approach:** Integration of dynamic feature selection with gated neural networks for increased interpretability.
- **High Performance:** AUC of 0.96, setting a benchmark in pulmonary microbiota studies related to immunotherapy.
- **Data Utilization:** Examination of various biological informational levels â€“ Clinical, Metabolites, Family, Genus, Species, Strain.

## Perfoermance

- The AUC (Area Under the Curve) scores for the best iteration of ICI (Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor) response classifiers.
- The X-axis represents the data feature sources used by the classifiers, including Clinical, Metabolites, Family, Genus, Species, and Strain. These feature sources represent different biological information levels commonly employed in predicting ICI treatment responses.

- **AUC Scores:** Depict the performance of ICI response classifiers using different data features.
- **X-Axis:** Represents the data feature sources employed, such as Clinical, Metabolites, Family, Genus, Species, and Strain.
- **Composite Features:** Combination of mNGS and meta features yielded the highest AUC (0.9631).
